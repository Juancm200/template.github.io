I wanted to write this blog post to sum up stuff that I’ve done or learned this year. Keep in mind this is being written off the top of my head - I did not keep a journal throughout the year, but hopefully that’s something I’ll do in 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"complexity-is-your-enemy\">Complexity is your enemy<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#complexity-is-your-enemy\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>As programmers, we are puzzle-solvers. We like to think outside the box, applying different concepts, putting all of those nice things we’ve learned everywhere. This… often backfires. Most of the time what works best are the simplest solutions, which are also easier to maintain in the future by you or others. I’ve seen this quote somewhere a while back: “Programmers spend the first years of their careers mastering complexity only to realize they should master simplicity instead”. I guess I’m not in my first years anymore?</p>\n<p>I’ve changed my process in writing code to this:</p>\n<ol><li>Understand the problem/goal;</li>\n<li>Draw a simple mental picture of how to solve it (really simplify it);</li>\n<li>Code in small steps and test them as you go;</li>\n<li>Make it work. Code can look quite ugly in this step;</li>\n<li>Optimize it, performance-wise;</li>\n<li>⭐️ Try to explain how it works to yourself (mentally or by text), and then refactor the code to be as simple as possible;</li></ol>\n<p>This last step might make the initial release take a little longer, but oh boy does it pay off whenever you or someone else has to maintain it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vanilla-js-is-the-best\">Vanilla JS is the best<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#vanilla-js-is-the-best\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Wait, I’m not saying you shouldn’t use any framework. If it helps you do your work better, go ahead! But “Vanilla” JS has come such a long way and there are so many amazing APIs coming out that using it solely is a valid option again. But more than that, those APIs are built in a way that popular frameworks can use them and communicate with each other with little effort. I’ve covered a bit of this on <a href=\"/microfrontends/\">my Microfrontends post</a>, but there are more APIs that I’ve discovered this year that are pretty awesome:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/microfrontends/\">Web Components/Shadow DOM/Custom Elements</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"/web-workers/\">Web Workers</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IntersectionObserver</a>;</li>\n<li>Not exactly new, but <a href=\"/what-are-pwas-and-why-should-i-care-about-them/\">PWAs</a> are increasingly awesome;</li></ul>\n<h2 id=\"jekyll\">Jekyll<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#jekyll\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>I’m a bit late to the party, but this is still something I’ve found out about in 2019. This website/blog you’re seeing is built on top of Jekyll, a tool for making static websites.</p>\n<p>Basically, you have HTML, CSS and JS. Add some special powers for using variables/loops inside that HTML code and ta-da! It works. Jekyll also allows you to create pages from Markdown (.md) files. I use it for blog posts like this one.</p>\n<p>Since it’s a static website, it means the code that’s served to users/visitors is compiled just once and then served as HTML files. No servers or APIs necessary. It’s pretty cool. You can check more about Jekyll <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and can check the source code for my website <a href=\"https://github.com/matfantinel/matfantinel.github.io\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-source-is-awesome\">Open Source is awesome<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#open-source-is-awesome\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>I have released two open-source apps this year for elementaryOS (<a href=\"https://github.com/matfantinel/reminduck\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reminduck</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/matfantinel/moneta\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moneta</a>). I gotta say, besides the fact that I was learning an entirely different development stack (Vala, GTK, Desktop native), the best “new” thing I enjoyed was doing it in the open.</p>\n<p>These are not complex, commercial apps or anything like that. They’re small utilities that I use on a daily basis and that were made open and released in hopes of helping anyone out there too. And I gotta say, having users like your software is great, but having them actively contribute to it is even better. As soon as they were released/made public, I started receiving pull requests, bug reports, feature requests, and translations from everywhere. <strong>It’s so amazing that people from all over the world took interest in my little idea and helped improve them any way they could.</strong></p>\n<p>But open source is not just other people contributing to your projects, it’s also the opposite! I can improve other people’s apps that I use, I can report bugs openly and help out, or just download the source code, change a few things just to fit my workflow better and run it. And not only apps, I can do that with the entire OS I run on my PC! Not to mention having access to other people’s code allows you to learn from their work and saves you tons of time. Having a problem on your app and you know one that has solved that? Just check out what they did. Copy it, modify it, learn it, ship it. It’s all good.  <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">We wouldn’t have to spend so much time reinventing wheels if more of our code was open.</span></p>\n<p>Ah, this website is also open source. I used others as inspiration and took some code snippets too! So can you, feel free to fork it and modify anyway you want.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-remotely-is-fun-at-least-for-some-people\">Working remotely is fun, at least for some people<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#working-remotely-is-fun-at-least-for-some-people\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>In August I started working remotely for the first time. I work from my home in Brazil with people from US, Europe and India. It was definitely refreshing to not have to commute and always be at a place that makes you feel good. Not only that, but the flexible hours allow me to work whenever I want and I can enjoy things that weren’t possible on a regular “9 to 5” routine.</p>\n<p>Although… I end up working the same hours as I did before. It feels “right” to work at this time, and I can enjoy my family at night, since they also work during the day. But it’s nice to have the flexibility to have a break and a coffee somewhere else during the day if needed.</p>\n<p>One of the main things people say about working from home is that sometimes it’s hard to separate work time from free time. Fortunately, I didn’t have that issue. My apartment is quite small, so I don’t have a proper office and instead work on a desk on my bedroom, which means the temptation of lying down and sleeping is always beside me. I’m so thankful I am able to resist that and get work done. And after work hours I can fully disconnect from it and not be stressed out, even if I stay on the computer. I totally understand why some people would not enjoy this and would be less productive, fortunately I was not the case.</p>\n<p>The one thing I’d say is worse in my case is communication. I’m not an extremely social person - therefore I don’t miss chitchat during the day with colleagues or anything like that. It’s just that it’s harder to explain code and concepts over a call or screen share. Not everyone is always readily available to explain things because of different timezones, so you have to figure more things out on your own. It’s still doable though, and the days of “just coding” without interruptions are a dream. The pros outweight the cons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theres-never-enough-time\">There’s never enough time<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#theres-never-enough-time\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>This year, I started getting into writing more open source software and started working from home. The latter means I can work more on house chores since there’s no commute and I’m always around! Still, there’s never enough time for me to do what I want to do. I took time to write some elementaryOS apps, but I want to do some web apps too, and code some more, and play some games, watch series, movies, hang out with family, work, write on this blog, oof. This isn’t a new discovery by any means, but I feel like it’s getting worse every year. This is adult life, I guess.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#wrapping-up\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Anyway, 2019 was a good year. I (of course) hope to do more and better in 2020, hopefully including more articles here.

The ongoing pandemic still affected our lives, and even though most people in my country are now vaccinated (including me), the danger still exists and preventive measures are still necessary. But it’s nice to be able to start doing things and going places we haven’t been able to for a while. I personally think this situation is still going to drag on for a while, but we’ll adapt to it with time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mental-health\">Mental Health<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#mental-health\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/2020-year-in-review\">Last year</a>, I wrote a bit about doomscrolling, and how it started affecting me until I decided to avoid this behavior. I tried to keep avoiding it this year, and I think I succeeded. I’m not blind to what’s going on - I still know <div class=\"sparkle-wrapper svelte-exdx8u\">\n\t<div class=\"slot-wrapper svelte-exdx8u\"><strong class=\"text-secondary\">the world is a dumpster fire</strong></div>\n</div> at the moment and in many ways it was even worse than 2020 - but I think I was successful in not dwelling on the bad news and the daily absurdities going on.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean my mental health didn’t take a hit though. The year started with the loss of a person I held dear - a victim of the inexcusable vaccination delays and genocidal actions of our leaders - and I felt like I lost a bit of control over my work-life-balance for a portion of the year.</p>\n<p>This year I also started therapy though, which I feel is a good way to deal with the growing anxiety from the past few years. I’ve been able to know more about myself and how my brain works, so I can focus on what I found out to improve my life, one day at a time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"work-life\">Work Life<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#work-life\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Early this year I changed jobs, and started working as a contractor. This has given me more freedom to make my own hours and allowed me to work with a more diverse set of people. It took me a while to use this freedom the right way, though. For a few months I felt like my work-life balance was off, and I felt like my energy was being drained fast. Luckily I was able to notice the early signs of a burnout and took a step back to avoid it. I am now working on my 2nd project as a contractor and I feel that getting the work hours under control allowed me to do my work better, since my mind gets the time to rest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learning-and-comparing\">Learning and Comparing<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#learning-and-comparing\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Most of the learning I did this year was on my day job, and not personal projects. Last year, I worked a lot with Angular and Vue 2. This year, I worked with Vue 3, React and PHP (😩), and on my personal time I started to practice my Svelte skills. That’s a lot of frameworks!</p>\n<p>Although every project is different, working with components makes you solve similar problems all the time. And after having worked with basically all mainstream frameworks for a bit, I feel like I can see pros and cons to each of them:</p>\n<h3 id=\"angular\">Angular<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#angular\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Pros:</strong> it’s very opinionated, which means there are always recommended ways of doing something. This makes the code consistent, and using TypeScript by default makes it much easier to maintain big projects. I like the template syntax and the separation between HTML, CSS and TS. I also can definitely see why it’s a choice in many enterprise environments: the majority of Angular projects I’ve seen have similar structure, which makes devs productive really quickly after being hired.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> it’s very opinionated, which means it’s not as flexible as other options. The focus on clear separation of concerns and TypeScript can also be a burden for smaller apps. Sometimes you want to make a quick prototype or just build something simpler, and it’s easy to find Angular overkill.</p></li></ul>\n<h3 id=\"vue\">Vue<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#vue\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Pros:</strong> I really like the premise of Vue being “incrementally adoptable”. This makes Vue really simple on the surface and hides many of its complexities. The template syntax is similar to Angular and it’s easy to keep concerns separated if you want to.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> In my personal experience I felt like the Composition API, introduced in Vue 3, goes against my favorite things in Vue previously. Instead of being an extension to HTML/JS, it makes you completely rethink how to build the components, and I feel like it makes things more complicated than they should be. Also, the ecosystem around it (plugins, components, etc) took a big hit with the transition from v2 to v3, because it had many breaking changes.</p></li></ul>\n<h3 id=\"react\">React<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#react\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>My experience with React has not been as extensive as the other ones here, so I think I’m still not past the point of “initial impressions”. Still, here are my thoughts:</p>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Super flexible, and with a ginormous ecosystem to back it up. You can write a React app in so many ways and there’s always an open-source plugin or component for what you want to do. The existence of NextJS makes using React a better experience.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Ok, I really don’t like JSX. I usually like to keep concerns separated and using JS to build the HTML like this is not my cup of tea. I find it hard to understand at a glance, and feel like it overrides the default web stack too much. Unlike the other frameworks, when I use React I feel like I’m developing a React app instead of a web app. Also, in contrast to Angular, the flexibility of React makes it so that React projects can be so different from one another you’d have a difficult time adapting, even though they use the same framework (this is mitigated by meta-frameworks like NextJS, which are very opinionated, thankfully).</p></li></ul>\n<h3 id=\"svelte\">Svelte<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#svelte\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>I have a clear favorite here, but I feel that Svelte hits the sweet spot in many ways.</p>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Pros:</strong> I like the template syntax (not as clean as Vue’s or Angular’s, but similar enough), the clear separation of concerns, and how it likes to stay out of your way. Most of all though, I love how Svelte makes me just feel like I’m building a “vanilla” web page, but with added goodies. <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">It extends the web instead of replacing it.</span></p></li>\n<li><p>The fact that it is a compiler frees it from the need for a Virtual DOM, which then makes the code you need to write much simpler. No need for <em>useState</em>, <em>useEffect</em>, or keeping track of two-way binding to maintain state between components - you just have to set the variables and Svelte does the rest. I just think about my logic, not about how the framework works.</p></li>\n<li><p>Its official meta-framework, SvelteKit, also has great defaults. It works by using native HTML tags instead of trying to emulate them. Instead of a <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code>, just use <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. Instead of using JS to post data, just use a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>. This makes the app leaner, more accessible, and work with JS disabled by default.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Svelte is relatively new, and therefore its ecosystem is still lacking. I’ve had trouble properly integrating a SvelteKit project with Storybook or Jest, for example, since Kit is still in Beta. There are also many components that don’t have a Svelte version yet, and while some of them have a “Vanilla JS” option that usually works, it’s still not as seamless as it could be.</p></li></ul>\n<h2 id=\"personal-projects\">Personal Projects<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#personal-projects\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>I didn’t work on many personal projects this year, as I was already learning a lot on my day job. I did, however, <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">completely rewrite my website!</span></p>\n<p>I really liked the previous one, but I wanted to change some things about it and use something more flexible than Jekyll. So I completely redesigned it using Figma - while retaining some design elements from before - and rewrote it with SvelteKit. <a href=\"https://fantinel.dev/blog-development-sveltekit/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">I wrote a blog post talking more about the experience</a>, which also became my most-read post of all time. Nice!</p>\n<p>Speaking of blog posts, <div class=\"sparkle-wrapper svelte-exdx8u\">\n\t<div class=\"slot-wrapper svelte-exdx8u\"><strong class=\"text-secondary\">I doubled the amount of posts published compared to last year!</strong></div>\n</div> Which means I wrote… <strong>4</strong> (excluding this one). I wanted to write more, but compared to the 2 posts from last year, it’s still an improvement, <em>right</em>?</p>\n<h2 id=\"fun\">Fun<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#fun\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Not everything is code and gloom - I also do some fun things every once in a while.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tv-and-movies\">TV and Movies<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#tv-and-movies\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Ted Lasso</strong> is the TV equivalent of a hug. I’ve never seen a show that can balance comedy, wholesomeness and an enthralling story and characters so well. It touches on delicate subjects in a way that still makes you feel good, and yet is capable of sending the intended message. Honestly can’t find anything I dislike about it.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Better Call Saul</strong> was surprisingly good. I initially dismissed it as being just a spin-off of a popular show, but it slowly evolved into a tightly-woven drama that keeps me at the edge of my seat. The stakes are lower here than they are in Breaking Bad, but I feel like I care more about the characters on this one.</p></li></ul>\n<h3 id=\"games\">Games<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#games\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<ul><li><p><strong>The Last of Us</strong> was surprisingly surprising for me. I am 8 years late to the party here, but I didn’t have a PlayStation since the PS1, and not only I hadn’t played this game, I never felt like doing so. I usually favor creative gameplay instead of a complex story, but finally gave it a go this year. Wow. It was an amazing experience from start to finish, though I admit it felt more like a more immersive movie than a game. That being said, I don’t think any movie can match the immersion that a game with a good story can provide.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>No Man’s Sky</strong> is a mix of exploration and existential crisis. There are a lot of things to do (though not all of them have much depth), but the main gameplay loop of exploring planets and seamlessly traversing between them is addictive. Plus, the main story was surprisingly good, with a lot of amazing quotes from the Travellers in that universe. A bit of existential crisis was the icing on the cake.</p></li></ul>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/2021-year-in-review/no-mans-sky.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/2021-year-in-review/no-mans-sky.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/2021-year-in-review/no-mans-sky.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of a character in No Man&#39;s Sky saying: &#39;Existence is beautiful, if you let it be.

I never liked games of this genre (Metroidvania) until I played Hollow Knight, last year. I felt like finally giving Metroid a chance since it was the first main entry in 19 years and the reviews were stellar. I was not disappointed. I feel like it doesn’t match Hollow Knight in its worldbuilding and ambientation, but the gameplay in Metroid Dread felt much more fluid, making almost everything in it a joy.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> has continued to be one of the highlights of my weeks. My party still played online this year, but it was a lot of fun. We finally finished the Curse of Strahd campaign after 502 days.

The sheer amount of false information and hatred being spread through both social media and real life is becoming bigger every passing day.</p>\n<p>They can be shared by ignorance, personal or political interest, or simply to “watch the world burn”.

Checking many times a day for news, how the pandemic was growing, getting angry at how our leaders were dealing with it, and more.

Learned a lot of things while building it:<ul><li>State management in Angular projects, with <a href=\"https://ngrx.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NgRx</a>;</li>\n<li>Offline functionality with IndexedDB in the browser;</li>\n<li>Improved CSS Animations;</li>\n<li>Improved Ionic and PWA knowledge;</li>\n<li>Improved performance knowledge, with Web Workers, Virtual Scrolling and Lazy Loading;</li></ul></li>\n<li>I redesigned part of my website - I decided to change things up a bit, with an animated (but still lightweight) header background, a new logo, typography improvements, code highlighting, and more. I think it looks more professional than before, and represents my way of building things better as well;</li>\n<li>I built <a href=\"https://github.com/matfantinel/resume\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">my Resume as a Web Component</a> - using StencilJS to build it, and CSS Grid for the layout. Both of those things were new to me, so it was pretty interesting;</li>\n<li>I learned about <a href=\"/css-scroll-snapping/\">CSS Scroll Snapping</a> - a fantastic new CSS capability that helps with reducing the amount of JS in our websites;</li>\n<li>I focused a lot on improving my design skills this year. While I’m still a developer (and plan on continuing to be), designing things is something I find very fun. I learned messing with a few design-related things this year:<ul><li>Edit SVG files in Inkscape - still a lot to learn, but I’m already capable of doing some edits to existing files;</li>\n<li>Build high-fidelity mockups in Figma - being able to design more quickly than I was by building it was great for speeding up the process, and being able to collect feedback earlier was fantastic as well;</li></ul></li>\n<li>I started to contribute a bit more to Open Source projects, like <a href=\"https://elementary.io\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">elementary OS</a>. Mainly with a still-in-progress website rebuild, but also with tons of feedback, issue reports, offering support and participating on discussions.</li></ul>\n<h2 id=\"fun\">Fun<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#fun\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Since I committed myself to stop seeing bad things and focus on good ones, I resorted to at-home entertainment a lot this year. My highlights:</p>\n<h3 id=\"tv-and-movies\">TV and Movies<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#tv-and-movies\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Mr. Robot</strong> was a jaw-dropping series. I started watching it just this year, and binged to the finale quickly. It was an incredibly powerful series, with genius writing and cinematography. Highly recommend it to anyone, even if not a fan of the tech/hacking theme;</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Community</strong> was a great find; It’s not a series I had ever heard of when it was still airing, as it never got popular here in Brazil. However, after hearing about it on the web and finding it on Netflix, I’m so glad I started watching it. Loads of fun, full of references, internal jokes and Dan Harmon genius;</p></li></ul>\n<h3 id=\"games\">Games<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#games\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Animal Crossing New Horizons</strong> was one of the best things to happen this year. It’s far from a perfect game, but it could not have been better for the current situation, providing an easy escape into a world free of our current burdens. It came out at the beginning of quarantine and still provides daily wholesomeness to this day;</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> was a surprising source of fun considering my party only played online this year. But even with social distancing, we managed to have a lot of fun. With <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FoundryVTT</a>, things are much easier to handle and it’s not much harder to get immersed. I’m even trying to be a DM of my own campaign… I’m not sure it’s going as well as I hoped, but hey, at least I’m trying.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Hollow Knight</strong>… I’m so glad I played it. Being a Metroidvania, a genre I’m not really a fan of, it completely hooked me with its worldbuilding, art style, atmosphere and frustratingly satisfying difficulty. A 10/10 for me, for sure;</p></li></ul>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/2020-year-in-review/hollow-knight.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/2020-year-in-review/hollow-knight.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/2020-year-in-review/hollow-knight.png\" alt=\"Hollow Knight official artwork\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n    <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hollow Knight official artwork, by Team Cherry<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<h2 id=\"writing\">Writing<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#writing\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Well, since this is only the third blog post this year, I definitely did not do much writing.

It came out at the start of quarantine - and was extremely popular for providing an escape from that, with a virtual life that’s free of the problems we’re facing on the real one.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I was re-discovering <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ionic</a> and wanted to work on an app that would help me improve my knowledge of it, and as a bonus learn about other stuff I’ve been interested in. So, I decided to work on a companion app for the game I’ve been playing so much.</p>\n<p>This post illustrates my experience developing it. It is not a tutorial or an in-depth guide. It’s just meant to describe my experience, what I learned and any bumps in the way. In any case, the <a href=\"https://github.com/matfantinel/acnh-pocket-companion\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">source code is available on GitHub</a> for all to see and modify.

Even though you can create an app via their CLI, they also provide <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/start\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an online App Wizard</a> to do that visually. It’s a pretty cool way to display the starting templates, easily setting theme colors, default icon and the JS Framework you’ll use. I chose Angular for this one.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/wizard.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/wizard.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/wizard.png\" alt=\"Ionic app creation Wizard\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<p>After setting it up, the wizard gives you a CLI command with an ID to run on your machine. Therefore it still uses the CLI in the end, but it’s a nice touch for the starting experience.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/all-set.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/all-set.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/all-set.png\" alt=\"The wizard gives you a CLI command with an ID for you to run on your machine\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<p>After running that command, the CLI prompted me if I wanted to integrate with <a href=\"https://capacitorjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Capacitor</a>, which is a tool that makes the app deployable to Android/iOS. I accepted, since I plan to release it on the Play Store at some point. The main goal is to release the app as a <a href=\"/what-are-pwas-and-why-should-i-care-about-them/\">PWA</a>, but an Android version wouldn’t hurt, since the publishing process is almost-free and there’s almost zero extra effort involved. Publishing it for iPhones is not a goal due to the cost and effort required to publish on the App Store.</p>\n<p>After installation, I could run the app with <code>ionic serve</code>, which resulted in a template app with the settings I had set on the App Wizard.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/initial-template.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/initial-template.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/initial-template.png\" alt=\"The app created from the template created earlier\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<p>The default folder structure is pretty straightforward and should be familiar to anyone who has ever worked with Angular before.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/default-folder-structure.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/default-folder-structure.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/default-folder-structure.png\" alt=\"Default folder structure on an Ionic Angular app\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<h2 id=\"starting-development\">Starting development<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#starting-development\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Since I am a visual person, I decided to start work by changing the looks of the app first. This helps me stay motivated since I can see progress faster (because everything I do results in a visual change), and it also allows me to visualize the final product earlier, and gives me more time to think of good features or UX improvements.</p>\n<p>Even though I generated my project using the Tabs template, I decided that I don’t want tabs in my app. So I had to do a few changes to the routing configuration.</p>\n<p>First, I created a new page that I can use as the initial screen for my app. Ionic CLI makes it easy to create pages and components. Just running <code>ionic generate page home</code> created a page called Home, and automatically adds its modules to the Angular config, and its route to the Angular Router.</p>\n<p>After that, to remove the tabs, all I had to do was set the default route (<code>&#39;&#39;</code>) to redirect to home, and then I could delete all the Tab pages.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">app-routing.module.ts</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">typescript</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-typescript\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> NgModule <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@angular/core'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> PreloadAllModules<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> RouterModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> Routes <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@angular/router'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> routes<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Routes <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n    path<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">''</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    redirectTo<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'home'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    pathMatch<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'full'</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n    path<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'home'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token function-variable function\">loadChildren</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'./home/home.module'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">then</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span> m <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> m<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>HomePageModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token decorator\"><span class=\"token at operator\">@</span><span class=\"token function\">NgModule</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n  imports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    RouterModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">forRoot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>routes<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> preloadingStrategy<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> PreloadAllModules <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  exports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>RouterModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">AppRoutingModule</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"theming-and-layout\">Theming and Layout<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#theming-and-layout\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>For me, this is the best part. Ionic makes it SO easy to change themes! There’s a <code>variables.scss</code> file on the <code>theme</code> folder, where you can find Ionic’s default color palette and change anything. But they provide <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/color-generator\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an amazing Color Generator</a> that can make all the palette calculations for you. Just put your primary/secondary/success/danger/etc colors in there, and it will output the code for you to paste on your app.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/color-generator.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/color-generator.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/color-generator.png\" alt=\"Ionic&#39;s color generation\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<p>After some time styling, I modified the layout of the two page skeletons I wanna have, the Home page (that mimics the Nookphone in the game), and I styled the header of the other pages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/skeleton.gif\" alt=\"Gif of my app's base skeleton\"></p>\n<p>Since I wanted to have the same header on all pages, I ended up creating a component for it. Since I had already two components and six pages, I decided to split them up in different folders (I honestly don’t know why Ionic doesn’t do that by default). My folder structure ended up like this:</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/modified-folder-structure.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/modified-folder-structure.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/modified-folder-structure.png\" alt=\"The folder structure after my modifications\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<p>Also, to be able to import the same component into multiple Pages (each page with its own module), I had to create the ComponentsModule. This required a bit of searching because I wasn’t familiar with this approach yet. ComponentsModule by itself is very simple, I just import the Components there:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">components.module.ts</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">typescript</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-typescript\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> NgModule <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@angular/core'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> CoolHeaderComponent <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'./cool-header/cool-header.component'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> IonicModule <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@ionic/angular'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token decorator\"><span class=\"token at operator\">@</span><span class=\"token function\">NgModule</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n    declarations<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>CoolHeaderComponent<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    imports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>IonicModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">forRoot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    exports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>CoolHeaderComponent<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">ComponentsModule</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>The annoying part was having to add ComponentsModule to each of the pages. There probably is an easier way of handling this, but right now I decided to not dig too deep into it.</p>\n<p>After making the skeleton of the app, I started working on some specific pages. I started with the home screen, that mimics a cell phone’s app grid. I’ll probably add more options as the app evolves, but for now this is good enough to build the layout with.</p>\n<p>The next screen to be done was the <em>Island</em> one. It is a simple form with some text inputs, a datepicker and a couple of dropdowns. I used Ionic’s default components for them and styled them with CSS so they fit the app’s style better. Everything was pretty simple to do and worked great. Ionic’s docs made it super easy to find the available options and easier ways to theme.</p>\n<p>I wanted to add another thing to this screen too, though: a section containing the island’s villagers, and a search box that allows the user to select them. Just adding another “card” to the UI and making it scroll would deliver what I want, but it wouldn’t look <em>awesome</em>. GitHub’s recently released mobile app has this bottom drawer that I personally found awesome:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/github-drawer.gif\" alt=\"GitHub's cool bottom drawer\"></p>\n<p>Luckily for me, someone’s already worked on something like that for Ionic, which means I don’t have to do it from scratch! <a href=\"https://github.com/AnthonyCifuentes/ion-slide-drawer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to check it on GitHub. Unfortunately it is not (at the time of writing) available as an installable component on NPM or somewhere else. But the code is simple and I just copied it over to my own project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"state-management\">State Management<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#state-management\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Since the entire point of this app is learning, I decided to use <a href=\"https://ngrx.io\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NgRx</a>. It is a State Management library for Angular that works in a similar way to VueX or Redux. I’ve worked with VueX recently and really like the concept, so I decided to make use of it here.</p>\n<p>I started by adding it to my application with <code>npm i @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/store-devtools @ngrx/schematics --save</code>. If you wanna learn more about NgRx, I used <a href=\"https://indepth.dev/how-to-start-flying-with-angular-and-ngrx/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this amazing tutorial</a> to learn it for this app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"database\">Database<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#database\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>The best way to store data in an app like mine - supposed to work on Android, iOS and the Web, but still entirely offline - is using the browser’s IndexedDB. It’s basically a simpler SQL database for your web app that lives inside the browser. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">You can read more on MDN if you’d like</a>.</p>\n<p>While useful, IndexedDB has a very low-level API, which makes it hard to get started with. Which is why I chose to use <a href=\"https://dexie.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dexie.js</a> as a wrapper for IndexedDB. It allows me to use a simple API to query data, while already doing the needed optimizations.</p>\n<p>Simply installing Dexie.js and a quick read on its documentation allowed me to successfully store and read persistent data for my app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"putting-some-other-cool-things-in-practice\">Putting some other cool things in practice<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#putting-some-other-cool-things-in-practice\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Since the main purpose of developing this app is learning, I decided to use some cool stuff I’ve learned and put them in practice:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/web-workers/\">Web Workers</a>: on first run, the app uses a web worker to parse the game data (contained in large JSON files) in the background, so it can fill the database with the data used on Critterpedia</li>\n<li>Virtual Scroll: on the Critterpedia listings, I used Virtual Scroll instead of pagination. I figured this was a better choice because while it can have a lot of items, it’s a fixed number so no need to paginate. This way it maintains good performance on scrolling even on lower-end devices. Luckily, <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/virtual-scroll\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ionic provides a built-in component for that</a>!</li>\n<li>Lazy loading images: since all items in the list have an icon that’s displayed besides them, there are lots of images to download. Without lazy-loading, ALL images would be loaded right off the bat, even the ones way down the bottom of the list. With lazy loading, the browser automatically downloads only images as they would appear on screen by just setting the <code>loading</code> attribute: <code>&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;</code></li></ul>\n<h2 id=\"running-on-android\">Running on Android<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#running-on-android\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>After having a few parts of my app done, I decided it was time to run in on my Android phone, to have a better look of how it will look and feel on an actual device.</p>\n<p>The first step for this is installing Android Studio. Install instructions may vary depending on your operating system. I’m on a Linux-based OS so I installed it from <a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/android-studio\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Snapcraft</a>. You can follow the instructions from the <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/android\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ionic docs</a> if you’d prefer.</p>\n<p>After installing Android Studio, we need to add an environment variable that points to the Android SDK. In the following command (Linux, Mac), replace the directory with the one where the Sdk is installed in your PC, then add it to the end of your <code>.bashrc</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">shell</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-shell\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">export</span> <span class=\"token assign-left variable\">ANDROID_SDK_ROOT</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token environment constant\">$HOME</span>/Library/Android/sdk</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Adding these next lines to the <code>.bashrc</code> file will also give you a quick way to access these Android tools if needed:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">shell</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-shell\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token comment\"># avdmanager, sdkmanager</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">export</span> <span class=\"token assign-left variable\"><span class=\"token environment constant\">PATH</span></span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token environment constant\">$PATH</span><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">:</span><span class=\"token variable\">$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT</span>/tools/bin\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># adb, logcat</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">export</span> <span class=\"token assign-left variable\"><span class=\"token environment constant\">PATH</span></span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token environment constant\">$PATH</span><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">:</span><span class=\"token variable\">$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT</span>/platform-tools\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># emulator</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">export</span> <span class=\"token assign-left variable\"><span class=\"token environment constant\">PATH</span></span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token environment constant\">$PATH</span><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">:</span><span class=\"token variable\">$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT</span>/emulator</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Now, we have to register Android as a platform for our app. Since we’re using Capacitor to make this bridge, we need only a single command:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">shell</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-shell\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-shell\">ionic capacitor <span class=\"token function\">add</span> android</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p><em>If you get an error saying that “Capacitor could not find the web assets directory”, be sure to run <code>ionic build</code> to generate this directory first.</em></p>\n<p>After that’s done, you can open the project in Android Studio (it will be on a folder called <code>Android</code> at the root of your project). If you still haven’t setup a device or emulator to run your app in, do it now. The <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/android#android-studio\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ionic docs</a> show how to do both processes.</p>\n<p>After a loooong while, Android Studio will have loaded all it needs to run your project. Just click on Run (Shift+F10). It should open on your phone/emulator!</p>\n<h2 id=\"pwa-preparation\">PWA preparation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#pwa-preparation\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>To be able to publish the app as a PWA, we need to add a Service Worker and a Manifest. Thankfully, Angular already has the CLI and the packages that allows us to do that easily. <code>ng add @angular/pwa</code> worked like a charm. This automatically added the needed files, and wired it up with the existing Angular modules automatically.</p>\n<p>After that, I edited <code>ngsw-config.json</code> and <code>manifest.webmanifest</code> files with my app’s name and colors, and I replaced all generated icons with my own. For more details on how to create PWAs with Angular, <a href=\"/angular-pwa-how-to/\">check my specific post for that</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"routing-issue\">Routing issue<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#routing-issue\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>One issue I was having after publishing a PWA like that is that when refreshing my app on the browser, it was throwing a 404 error. This happened because the route had changed and Angular lost track of what it was supposed to open. I fixed this by changing a line in my <code>app-routing.module.ts</code> and adding <code>useHash: true</code> to the settings:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">app-routing.module.ts</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">typescript</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-typescript\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token decorator\"><span class=\"token at operator\">@</span><span class=\"token function\">NgModule</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n  imports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    RouterModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">forRoot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>routes<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> preloadingStrategy<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> PreloadAllModules<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> useHash<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  exports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>RouterModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"publishing\">Publishing<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#publishing\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>To host my PWA, I decided to use <a href=\"https://netlify.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netlify</a>. The publishing experience was quite easy and friction-free, and they also provide a free hosting plan which is perfect to host this demo-only-app. I will not document how the publishing proccess worked here because their UI is very intuitive and their docs would be way better than mine anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#wrapping-up\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Developing this definitely took me a while - but that’s because time’s been quite scarce for me. Most of the development time was spent learning NgRx, which was definitely the most complex part of this application. It also took me a while to find a good IndexedDB wrapper before I settled on Dexie. The rest was quite straightforward - the app logic is simple, and what took the longest was making the app pretty and the animations smooth. </p>\n<p>I think the result is quite good - definitely not professional, but more than enough for a hobby app. I learned a lot working on it and would definitely do it again.
